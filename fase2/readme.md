The folders containing frank-runner and frankframework are both combined 10gb, hence i made two folders where the files that have been adjusted are placed.

For FFramework the eureka is situated in the following structure:

**frankframework\core\src\main\java\org\frankframework**

For the httpSender its 
**frankframework\core\src\main\java\org\frankframeworkg\http**


Regarding FrankRunner the NetflixConfig should be placed in the following

**frank-runner\examples\Frank2Example1\configurations**

To run the applications run the batch file of 
    frank-runner\specials\iaf-webapp
Do make sure that frankframework is placed in the same folder as frank-runner. Just like in the Project. Its also advised to follow the instructions of frank-runner in regards how to run it. [Frank-Runner](https://github.com/wearefrank/frank-runner)

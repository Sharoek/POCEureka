Open Zaak was originally created in late 2019 based on the reference
implementation of the VNG standards for "API's voor Zaakgericht werken".

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made Open Zaak that much
better:

    Andy Verberne
    Anna Shamray <anna@maykinmedia.nl>
    Eric Herman <eric@publiccode.net>
    Jan Ainali <jan@publiccode.net>
    Joeri Bekker <joeri@maykinmedia.nl>
    Sergei Maertens <sergei@maykinmedia.nl>
    Shea Meyers <shea@maykinmedia.nl>
    Silvia Amabilino <silvia@maykinmedia.nl>

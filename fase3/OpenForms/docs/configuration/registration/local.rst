==================
Local (no backend)
==================

Open Forms does not require to have an external registration backend to be 
selected. If you don't select an external registration backend, the submissions
are stored only within Open Forms.

The submissions can be exported by users with the appropriate permissions:

1. In Open Forms, navigate to: **Submissions** > **Submissions**
2. Use the navigation tools like the search bar and the filters on the right to browse the submissions.
3. Use the checkboxes on each row to select the submissions to be exported.
4. In the **Actions** pull-down menu pick one of the **Export** options to export as a CSV or Excel file.

Decision Modelling Notation
===========================

Decision Modelling Notation (DMN) is an
`international standard <https://www.omg.org/dmn/>`_ for modelling *rules* resulting
in certain outputs given certain input values. DMN is a machine-readable XML-based
format which typically defines one or more decision tables that can be evaluated.

In Open Forms it is possible to use form logic rules that call a DMN engine to
evaluate decision tables. The result of the evaluation can be used to update the value of variables in the form.

For the developer documentation about DMN, see :ref:`developers_backend_modules_dmn`.

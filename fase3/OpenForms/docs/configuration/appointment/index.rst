Appointments configuration
==========================

The appointments module follows our typical plugin structure, however you can only
globally select one plugin at a time. It is not possible to configure different plugins
on different forms.

To configure appointments, follow the steps below:

#. In the admin interface, navigate **Configuration** > **Configuration overview**

#. Find the "Appointment plugins" section, which lists all supported plugins.

#. Pick the relevant plugin and click the **Configuration** link on the right.
   See below for plugin-specific instructions.

#. Then, navigate to **Configuration** > **Appointment configuration**.

#. In the **Appointment plugin** dropdown, select the plugin you configured and want to use.

#. Click **Save** to save the configuration. Optionally, you can save and edit again
   to configure a :ref:`pre-selected location <manual_forms_examples_appointment_form_preselect_location>`.

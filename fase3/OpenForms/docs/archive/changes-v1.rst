1.1.2 (2022-06-16)
==================

Hotfix following 1.1.1

The patch validating uploaded file content types did not anticipate the explicit
wildcard configuration option in Formio to allow all file types. This caused files
uploaded by end-users to not be attached to the submission.

We've fixed the wildcard behaviour, but you should check your instances for incomplete
data. This involves a couple of steps with some pointers below.

1. The temporary uploads are automatically removed by the cronjobs at 3:30 UTC. The
   default setting is to do this after 2 days (48 hours). We have provided an example
   management command that you can use to check if you need to partially
   restore backups. Make sure to tweak the ``WINDOW_START`` and ``WINDOW_END`` variables
   to your specific situation - the start would be when you started deploying version
   1.0.9, and the end would be ``most recent 3:30 minus 48 hours``.

2. If you need to do partial restores, you should recover the records from the
   ``submissions_temporaryfileupload`` database table where the ``created_on`` timestamp
   lies in your interval. Additionally, you need to recover the file uploads of those
   relevant records. The paths are given by the column ``content``. You find those files
   in the ``private_media`` directory.

3. Finally, you can run the management command ``recover_missing_attachments``, which
   will report any issues and print out the references and IDs of the affected
   submissions.

1.1.1 (2022-06-13)
==================

Security release (:cve:`CVE-2022-31040`, :cve:`CVE-2022-31041`)

This bugfix release fixes two security issues in Open Forms. We recommend upgrading
as soon as possible.

* [:cve:`CVE-2022-31040`] Fixed open redirect in cookie-consent 'close' button
* [:cve:`CVE-2022-31041`] Perform upload content validation against allowed file types
* [:backend:`1670`] Update error message for number validation

1.1.0 (2022-05-24)
==================

Feature release 1.1.0

For the full list of changes, please review the changelog entries below for 1.1.0-rc.0
and 1.1.0-rc.1.

Since 1.1.0-rc.1, the following changes were made:

* Fixed maintaining the logo aspect ratio in the confirmation PDF for a submission
* Exposed options to display content/WYSIWYG text in confirmation emails
* WYSIWYG component content is displayed full-width in the confirmation email and PDF

1.1.0-rc.1 (2022-05-20)
=======================

Second release candidate for the 1.1.0 feature release.

* [:backend:`1624`] Fixed list of prefill attributes refresh on prefill plugin change
* Fixed styling issue with card components in non-admin pages
* [:backend:`1628`] Make fieldset labels stand out in emails
* [:backend:`1628`] Made styling of registration email consistent with confirmation email
* Added raw_id_fields to submissions admin for a performance boost
* [:backend:`1627`] Fixed CSRF error when authenticating in the admin after starting a form
* Fixed cookie ``SameSite=None`` being used in non-HTTPS context for dev environments
* [:backend:`1628`] Added missing form designer translations for display/summary options
* [:backend:`1628`] Added vertical spacing to confirmation PDF pages other than the first page

.. note:: :backend:`1627` caused session authentication to no longer be available in the API
   schema for the submission suspend/complete endpoints. This was not intended to be
   public API, so this option is gone now.

   Both of these endpoints require a valid submission ID to exist in the session to
   use them, which was the intended behaviour.

1.1.0-rc.0 (2022-05-17)
=======================

First release candidate of the 1.1.x release series!

Version 1.1.0 contains a number of improvements, both in the backend and SDK. All
changes are backwards compatible, but some features have been deprecated and will be
removed in version 2.0, see the last section of this changelog entry.

**Summary**

* The API spec has been bumped to version 1.1.0
* A new minor version of the SDK is available, which requires a minimum backend version
  of 1.1.0
* Upgrading should be straigh-forward - no manual interventions are needed.

**New features**

* [:backend:`1418`] Expose ``Submission.isAuthenticated`` in the API
* [:backend:`1404`] Added configuration options for required fields

  - Configure whether fields should be marked as required by default or not
  - Configure if an asterisk should be used for required fields or not

* [:backend:`565`] Added support for DigiD/eHerkenning via OpenID Connect protocol
* [:backend:`1420`] Links created by the form-builder now always open in a new window (by default)
* [:backend:`1358`] Added support for Mutual TLS (mTLS) in service configuration - you can now
  upload client/server certificates and relate them to JSON/SOAP services.
* [:backend:`1495`] Reworked admin interface to configure mTLS for SOAP services
* [:backend:`1436`] Expose ``Form.submissionAllowed`` as public field in the API
* [:backend:`1441`] Added submission-specific user logout endpoint to the API. This now clears the
  session for the particular form only, leaving other form session untouched. For
  authenticated staff users, this no longer logs you out from the admin interface. The
  existing endpoint is deprecated.
* [:backend:`1449`] Added option to specify maximum number of files for file uploads
* [:backend:`1452`] Added option to specify a validation regular-expression on telefone field
* [:backend:`1452`] Added phone-number validators to API for extensive validation
* [:backend:`1313`] Added option to auto redirect to selected auth backend
* [:backend:`1476`] Added readonly option to BSN, date and postcode components
* [:backend:`1472`] Improved logic validation error feedback in the form builder
* [:backend:`1482`, `backend`:`1510`] Added bulk export and import of forms functionality to the admin interface
* [:backend:`1483`] Added support for dark browser theme
* [:backend:`1471`] Added support for DigiD Machtigen and eHerkenning Bewindvoering with OIDC
* [:backend:`1453`] Added Formio specific file-upload endpoint, as it expects a particular
  response format for success/failure respones. The existing endpoint is deprecated.
* [:backend:`1540`] Removed "API" and "layout" tabs for the content component.
* [:backend:`1544`] Improved overview of different components in the logic rule editor.
* [:backend:`1541`] Allow some NL Design System compatible custom CSS classes for the content
  component.
* [:backend:`1451`] Completely overhauled "submission rendering". Submission rendering is used
  to generate the confirmation emails, PDFs, registration emails, exports...

  - You can now specify whether a component should be displayed in different modes
    (PDF, summary, confirmation email)
  - Implemented sane defaults for configuration options
  - PDF / Confirmation emails / registration emails now have more structure,
    including form step titles
  - Container elements (fieldsets, columns, steps) are only rendered if they have
    visible content
  - Logic is now respected to determine which elements are visible or hidden
  - Added a CLI render mode for debug/testing purposes
  - Fixed page numbers being half-visible in the confirmation PDF

* [:backend:`1458`] Submission registration attempts are now limited to a configurable upper
  bound. After this is reached, there will be no automatic retries anymore, but manual
  retries via the admin interface are still possible.
* [:backend:`1584`] Use the original filename when downloading submission attachments
* [:backend:`1308`] The admin interface now displays warnings and proper error messages if your
  session is about to expire or has expired. When the session is about to expire, you
  can extend it so you can keep working for longer times in the UI.

* [:backend:`1422`] Prevent update of custom keys on label changes for radio button components
  in the form builder

* [:backend:`1574`] Dropped Django 2.x SameSiteNoneCookieMiddlware

**Deprecations**

  submission-specific endpoint instead.
* [:backend:`1453`] The  ``/api/v1/submissions/files/upload`` endpoint is now deprecated. Use the
  formio-specific endpoint instead.
* ``Submission.nextStep`` is deprecated as it's unused, all the information to determine
  this is available from other attributes.

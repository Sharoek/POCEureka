"""
The :mod:`openforms.registrations` package provides the persistence backends
for submissions.

Once a form is submitted ('completed') by an end-user, a
:class:`openforms.submissions.models.Submission` instance is available holding all the
submitted data.

This data needs to be forwarded to the appropriate systems - it could be that a ``Zaak``
has to be created, or just an e-mail sent somewhere, or anything else. This package
provides a public Python API to trigger this mechanism, where each individual plugin
implements said appropriate system.

The registered plugins all have their own specific configuration and quirks, and we
will expose this to the form designers / editors. We couple a single form object to
a particular backend that needs to handle it.

# Mapping variables

Often form variables (from components and user-defined, optionally including static variables) need
to be mapped to or from another sort of variable/property. This can be achieved with the
`VariableMapping` component.

It is hardcoded to provide the form variable in one column, and takes a second column with the
'property' to map to/from. The direction of the mapping depends on the context where it's used.

## Data shape

The component operates on `Formik` data - you pass it the name (e.g. `container.mappings`) that
holds the array with the mapped items. Within each item, a key `formVariable` must be present that
contains the value/key of the form variable. The other key must be specified through the
`propertyName` prop.

In TypeScript-like code:

```ts
// K must be the `propertyName` prop
interface Mapping<K extends string> {
  formVariable: string;
  [K]: any;
}

const mappings: Mapping<'someProperty'>[] = [
  {
    formVariable: 'someFormComponent',
    someProperty: 'foo',
  },
];
```

# Form row

The form row acts as a container for one or more nested fields. This component cannot really be used
by itself, but is intended to be composed with the `Fieldset` component for proper alignment of form
field error lists.

## Single field

<Canvas of={FormRowStories.SingleField} />

## Multiple fields

<Canvas of={FormRowStories.MultipleFields} />

### Props

<ArgTypes of={FormRow} />
